# Edge AI Prototype: Garbage Classification

## Overview

This project demonstrates an Edge AI prototype for classifying recyclable garbage items using a lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN). The model is trained on a garbage classification dataset and converted to TensorFlow Lite format for deployment on edge devices like Raspberry Pi.

### Features
- Dataset preprocessing using TensorFlow utilities
- Training a small CNN model suitable for edge deployment
- Conversion to TensorFlow Lite model for efficient inference on devices
- Sample inference using the TFLite model
- Clear instructions for replicating the project in Google Colab or on Raspberry Pi
